Make sure to go throught the source code in the directory and for any questions, reachout to me on social media.
Remember this is simple C programs but more usefull.

	1. We have a program that asks and checks for a pin. It uses a while loop.

		Asks a user to type and enter a pin three times 
		if the correct one is entered access granted will be printed out, 
		three time out of trials will be printed and ask you to look for an administrator.

	2. We have a program for bookstore.

		It asks to enter number of books and calculates the dozens of books at that time.
		The program is compiled with gcc and provide output called d.  


	3. A program for ASCII values

		It will ask you for any character and will return an ASCII value of that character.
		And when you input an integer it will return ASCII value of that integer.
