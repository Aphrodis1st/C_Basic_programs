	1. We have a program that asks and checks for a pin. It uses a while loop.

		Asks a user to type and enter a pin three times 
		if the correct one is entered access granted will be printed out, 
		three time out of trials will be printed and ask you to look for an administrator.

	2. We have a program for bookstore.

		It asks to enter number of books and calculates the dozens of books at that time.
		The program is compiled with gcc and provide output called d.
